## How to run these code?

It is recommend that you should install the required libraries inside the virtual environment. 

1. In the Linux/UNIX system, follow bellow command to create the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    ```

    Or in the Windows environment, using this command:

    ```powershell
    python -m venv env
    ```

2. Then activate the environment in the Linux/UNIX system:

    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

    Or in the Windows environment:

    ```powershell
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. After that, install all the required libraries in the Linux/UNIX system:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Or the quite same command in the Windows:

    ```powershell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. After that, execute the program by the program name:

    ```bash
    python3 question_1.py
    python3 question_3.py
    python3 question_4.py
    ```

    Or in the Windows system:

    ```powershell
    python question_1.py
    python question_3.py
    python question_4.py
    ```

    Then just follow the instruction on the output terminal.

## Bonus

Since I have free time and enough interested, I made the bonus on the question 4, as it simutaniously mining all the blocks at the same time (except for the genesis block). You could test and enjoy it!
